Thanks to Pan-Chan for the game dump, TGE, and ThatTrueStruggle for the QuickBMS scripts.

bc001_c9 wouldn't export T-posed no matter what I tried.

Some of the persona cards seem to use the incorrect textures which I tried to mass fix but it didn't quite work 

card_1_Part should be card_b

card_0_part should be card_p

and card_dummy_0_part I assume would be card_r
